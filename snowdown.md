# SnowDown
A feature-rich downtime notificatoin utility.

Around winter time, with heavy snow power and internet outages become more common. It is important that we stay on top of our infrastructure, and part of that is knowing when it goes down. We can't constantly check ourselves, so why not have the computers do that?

## Installation
TBD

## Config
Config command will be:
```
snowdown config
```

This is created for Siege week 13 with the theme `winter`. Yes, I have a wonderfully loose interpretation of the theme. I just needed something to motivate me to write this, I have been meaning to for a while.
